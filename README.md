The Crawler Project
===================

This is an autonomously navigating robot built around a Maxstone/HSP 1/5th size RC Rock Crawler chassis.

There is no final design - every step is to be an evolutionary one with new functions and improvements to existing functions coming as I learn and refine my hardware hacking/building and software writing skills.

Please feel free to take the code and modify it for use in your robots. Just make sure you leave the accreditation bit at the top of the code and add your details to it.

#Second Alpha Release

This is the second stable alpha release that compiles without bugs.

## New in this version:

- Compass navigation
- GPS capability
- Autonomous navigation with 5 Waypoint limit
- Object avoidance from 30 cm out
- Collision detection and recovery

Please report any issues on Github. If you do not have a Github account, feel free to file a bug report/send your query to marzogh@icloud.com. I work on this project in my spare time so you might not get an immediate reply to your email, but rest assured I will get back to you ASAP.

### Disclaimer: 
This code is yet to be tested on the actual robot build. If you are looking for code that works out of the box, please wait for the final release - due sometime late Dec 2014. 
I do not accept any responsibility for any damage that you might cause to your test jig when using my code. Remember, as with most pre-release/amateur code - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
